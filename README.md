# spacehook

A simple webhook implementation for the [Deta Space Hackathon](https://spacehack23.deta.dev/).

Since deta.space allows a user to have their own custom url for an app and their own database, and app instance, I thought maybe it would be cool to create this kind of an app to allow an user to have a mock webhook or callback api.

## Deploy on deta.space
Get the space-cli from [here](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/space-cli/)

Authenticate with deta.space
```bash
space login
```
Push the app to your account
```bash
space push
```

## Run locally
```bash
space dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:4200` to try it out! Or try it on deta.space!
