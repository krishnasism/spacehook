A simple webhook implementation for the [Deta Space Hackathon](https://spacehack23.deta.dev/).

### Why?

Since deta.space allows a user to have their own custom url for an app and their own database, and app instance, I thought maybe it would be cool to create this kind of an app to allow an user to have an unique mock webhook or callback url.
