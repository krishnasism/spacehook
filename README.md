A simple webhook implementation for the [Deta Space Hackathon](https://spacehack23.deta.dev/).

### Why?

Since deta.space allows a user to have their own custom url for an app and their own database, and app instance, I thought maybe it would be cool to create this kind of an app to allow an user to have an unique mock webhook or callback url.

## Deploy to your own deta.space dev

Get the space-cli from [here](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/space-cli/)

Authenticate with deta.space
```bash
space login
```
Push the app to your account
```bash
space push
```

## Run locally
```bash
space dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:4200` to try it out! Or try it on deta.space!
